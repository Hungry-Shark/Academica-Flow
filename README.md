## 🚨 The Problem

Creating academic timetables is a **nightmare** that every educational institution faces. Administrators spend countless hours juggling:

- 📅 Faculty availability and preferences
- 🏫 Room capacity and equipment requirements  
- 👥 Student batch sizes and course conflicts
- ⚙️ Resource allocation and scheduling constraints
- 🔄 Last-minute changes and emergency adjustments

This manual process is **error-prone**, **time-consuming**, and often results in conflicts that frustrate both students and faculty.
